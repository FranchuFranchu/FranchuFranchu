## Welcome! This is my profile. 

I am FranchuFranchu, a young hobby programmer. 

### Things about me.

- I am a man, so I identify with the pronouns he/him/him.
- I live in Argentina and I am a native Spanish speaker.
- I am a practicing Catholic

### Projects

I frequently jump through many projects, and don't usually finish any of them. These are the ones I would say I'm "working" on.

- [exile](https://github.com/tjjfvi/exile), a type checker written in HVM with its own type system
- [async-kernel](https://github.com/FranchuFranchu/async-kernel), a RISC-V kernel written in Rust with asynchronicity as its main goal.

The following are projects I've stopped working on, but that got surprisingly far.

- [rust-0bsd-riscv-kernel](https://github.com/FranchuFranchu/rust-0bsd-riscv-kernel) A RISC-V kernel with a filesystem, at least.
- [purecraft](https://github.com/FranchuFranchu/purecraft), a Minecraft server written in Python. You can place blocks.
- [silver-rogue-df](https://github.com/FranchuFranchu/silver-rogue-df), A dwarf-fortress adventure mode-inspired rogue-like Pygame Python3 game. Incomplete but there is terrain generation at least. It's the only videogame I've published.

There are also some projects by other people I keep track of and want to contribute to:

- [Kind](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/Kind), a proof checker!
- [HVM](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/HVM), an optimal computation engine!

Projects by other people I have contributed to:

- [endless-sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky), a combat and trading sci-fi videogame.
- [Wikind](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/Kindex), a set of datatypes and proofs for Kind.

### Non-programming interests

- Mathematics! It's really beautiful.
- Constructed languages. Both making them, and learning them.

### Papers, articles, and blog posts I really like

- [Interaction Combinators](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81113716.pdf), a minimal model of computation. There are only three operations: swap-and-aggregate, duplicate, and erase. It has a captivating simplicity and elegance.
- [The Registers of Rust](https://without.boats/blog/the-registers-of-rust/), a comparison and analogy of many features Rust has.
